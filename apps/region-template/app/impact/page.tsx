        Even when our intentions are good, the way we show up can have deep consequences, especially for those who carry
        more risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        This guide invites you to reflect on your presence and your decisions before, during, and after response
        efforts. No one sees everything. But we all shape the outcome.
