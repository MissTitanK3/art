# 🎨 Contributing Guide for `@workspace/ui`

Welcome! This package defines all **shared UI components** (forms, maps, dialogs, hooks, styles). It should remain lightweight, reusable, and independent of any application data logic.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide **reusable UI components** used across apps and regions.  
- Keep `@workspace/ui` **data-agnostic** → components only accept props, never import stores or query databases directly.  
- Encapsulate design tokens, utility functions, and Tailwind setup for consistency.  
- Make it easy to copy/paste or drop this package into new apps without bringing in backend logic.

## 📐 Conventions

1. **Prop-driven design**  
   - Components must not import Zustand stores or talk to databases.  
   - State is passed in from apps or from `@workspace/store` hooks.  

2. **Accessibility first**  
   - Follow [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/) guidelines.  
   - Use Radix primitives or other a11y-friendly libraries where possible.  

3. **Styling**  
   - Use Tailwind utilities and `tailwind-merge` for class composition.  
   - Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.  

4. **Export patterns**  
   - Components should be exported from `src/components`.  
   - Re-export from `src/index.ts` for ergonomic imports.  

5. **Keep it general-purpose**  
   - UI components should not encode app-specific business rules.  
   - Example: `ProfileForm` accepts `value` and `onChange`, but does not know about Supabase or Zustand.

## 🛠 Adding a New Component

1. Add the component in `src/components/`.  
2. If it has internal state, keep it encapsulated (don’t rely on global stores).  
3. Add exports to `src/index.ts`.  
4. Ensure it has proper types for props.  
5. Test it in at least one app before committing.

## 🚫 What *not* to do

- ❌ Don’t import Zustand stores or backend APIs.  
- ❌ Don’t hardcode region- or app-specific logic.  
- ❌ Don’t duplicate existing design patterns.

## ✅ Example Usage

import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/Button"  

export function Demo() {  
  return <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>  
}
